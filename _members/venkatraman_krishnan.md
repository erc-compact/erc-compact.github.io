I am a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy and lead this ERC project. Previously, I was a postdoc at the same institute where, among other things, I co-lead the Relativisitc Binary working group of the MeerTime project. I obtained my PhD in Astrophysics at the centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing (CAS) at Swinburne University of Technology in Australia. 
    My research interests include neutron stars, binary systems, tests of gravity, signal processing and high performance computing.
