 Hi, I'm Robert. I completed my undergraduate degree at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, where I conducted research on neutron star interiors and the host galaxies of Type Ia supernovae. As a PhD student in the COMPACT project, I will be focusing on the search for relativistic binary pulsars, particularly on novel signal detection algorithms.
