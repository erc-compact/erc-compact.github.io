<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">PhD positions with COMPACT </h2>
<p></p>
<p> 🌌 Are you ready to dive into the mysteries of the universe and push the boundaries of physics and astronomy? We're thrilled to introduce you to the <b>PhD positions </b> available with the COMPACT project! 🌟</p>

<p>Imagine being part of a groundbreaking ERC starting grant project hosted at the MPIfR's Fundamental Physics in Radio Astronomy group. This project is all about uncovering the secrets of fast-spinning pulsars and compact binary systems, which are some of the hardest to find pulsars but have the potential to be some of the most useful tools to understand gravity.</p>

<p>🔍 But that's not all! These discoveries could unlock the secrets of gravity, reveal the internal structure of neutron stars, and even complement gravitational wave experiments. </p>

<p>📡 Our mission? To harness the power of the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa and the 100-m Effelsberg Telescope in Germany, along with cutting-edge algorithms, to hunt down these elusive cosmic wonders. We're talking petabyte-scale data analysis, using supercomputing systems worldwide with bleeding edge computing infrastructure.</p>

<p>🔬 As a student on this incredible journey, you'll be at the forefront of the action! You'll be setting up data acquisition, analysis, and pulsar detection pipelines using state-of-the-art programming and machine learning techniques. 🌐</p>

<p>🌠 Your discoveries won't stop there! You'll conduct follow-up observations and use pulsar timing techniques to extract invaluable scientific insights. You will have a great balance of observations, data analysis, interpretation and high profile science for your PhD! 🌌</p>

<p>🌟 Plus, the skills you'll gain are not just limited to astronomy. They open doors to various scientific and industrial fields, paving the way for your dream career. 🌍</p>

<p>Explore these opportunities at the MPIfR: <a href="https://blog.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/imprs/"> The IMPRS school </a>. Details of all available projects, including COMPACT-related positions can be found <a href="https://blog.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/imprs/for-applicants/phd-projects/"> here.</a></p>

<p>🚀 The COMPACT-related PhD projects you don't want to miss are MK03 and MK01! 🌌</p>

<p>📆 Mark your calendars! The formal application deadline via the IMPRS school is November 1, 2023. 🗓️</p>

<p> <b> If you're passionate about COMPACT and want to express your interest, we've got a form just for you: <a href="https://forms.gle/SbBB22NisB8sLbL28"> Expression of Interest Form</a> </b></p>
