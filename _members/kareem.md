I am currently a PhD student at the Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie, where I am part of the COMPACT project. My research focuses on the search and precise timing of new binary pulsars within globular clusters. Prior to joining the Max-Planck-Institut, I completed my Master's in Physics at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Kolkata. During my time at IISER, I collaborated with the Indian Pulsar Timing Array, where I concentrated on Pulsar Timing Arrays and the search for nanohertz gravitational waves.
