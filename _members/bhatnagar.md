I am Devika, a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy. As a part of the COMPACT group, I am currently exploring new avenues of pulsar candidate filtering. Previously, I pursued my Master's in Astrophysics from the Argelander Institute for Astronomy, University of Bonn, where I worked upon applications of Generative AI in the study of the Large Scale Structure of the Universe.
