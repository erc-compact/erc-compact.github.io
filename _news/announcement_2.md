Vishnu Balakrishnan joins COMPACT as a postdoctoral researcher!
***


Dr. Vishnu Balakrishnan joins COMPACT as a postdoctoral researcher. Vishnu completed his Ph.D. in Astrophysics at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany focussing on pulsar searches. His thesis included several novel ways of pulsar search data processing, including a search for ultra-relativistic binaries using template banks across the 5 Keplerian parameters, and generative adverserial neutral network for pulsar candidate classification. You can read his thesis <a href="https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:hbz:5-65608">here </a>. Soon after his PhD, he was involved in the TRAPUM project, and re-detected the pulsar M30B, 20-years after it was originally discovered! 

We welcome Vishnu to the team and wish him all the best for a successful time with the project!
